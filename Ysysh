Subject: Production Release Sign-Off Request: MCE Studio V3.5
Body:
Hi Team,
We're ready to release MCE Studio V3.5 to production and need your sign-off. This version includes the following key updates:
Key Changes & New Features:
 * TSS Data Source Update: Transitioned from fetching TSS data from the QIS factsheet to the QUOTATION database. This streamlines data retrieval and ensures consistency.
 * New Business Categories: Added "Market Index" and "Stock" as new business categories, expanding the scope of analysis.
 * Enhanced Auto-Complete Functionality: Implemented auto-complete for the following input fields to improve efficiency and reduce errors:
   * Strategy BBG Code
   * Core Benchmark BBG Code
   * Price Returns BBG Code
   * Net Total Return BBG Code
   * Other Benchmark/s BBG Code
   * Aggregation Tickers
Important Considerations:
 * Data Availability: Publications relying on tickers not present in the QUOTATION database will encounter issues. We'll highlight any failed data blocks in the generated mail.
 * Benchmark.xls Updates: Previously generated publications with tickers missing in the QUOTATION database will require those tickers to be added to the Benchmark.xls sheet for successful validation and generation.
For detailed information, please refer to the release notes: [Link to Wiki: MCE Studio V3.5 release notes - Webteam-Internet - Confluence]

Thank you for your cooperation.
Best regards,
